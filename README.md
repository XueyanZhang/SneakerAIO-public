# SneakerAIO [out-of-date]

NOTE this project is outdated and no longer maintained.
NOTE this project is solely for learning purposes.

SneakerAIO was a past project designed for my curiosity in web scraping and web automation.
The project has two main ways to interact with web services:
1. Selenium webdriver to mimic human interactions
2. Pure HTTP request to web servers

(Playwright seems to be a very strong compatitor to Selenium nowadays. Unfortunately, I do not have time to explore myself for now.)
